      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is <strong>Andro Dax Nacu</strong>. I enjoy recreational activities like hiking, boating, kayaking and fishing. But most of all i love spending time with my family especially with my two boys.</p>
      <p>I sometimes like to play videos on my spare time. More on PC gaming, but with a family, not as much. Mostly just play Wii Sports and Mario Kart with my son.</p>
      <p>I have live in the Pacific Northwest most of my life. Born and raised in Tacoma, WA. But also being a Navy brat, we have lived from the very tip of the US, Adak, Alaska and all the way down to San Diego, CA.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>Right after college came back to the US and worked for Fry's Electronics for my first job, as a telecom salesman. Then got hired at Verizon Wireless as technical support.</p>
      <p>During that time, got a call from Intrepid Learning Solutions to work for Boeing as a contractor to support their training organization. Started on Oct 2005. At the time, just to maintain some internal websites. But as I gained experience and more work coming in, Boeing decided to extend my contract, and continued to extend it, until they decided to hire me fulltime on May 2012. Pretty been doing it ever since.</p>
      <p>My time at Boeing has been great just continued to learn and developed alot of my skills, not just web development but also with the eLearning field. Instructional Design, Course development and all the authoring tools involved.</p>
      <p>In addition to improving some of my web development skills. I have also learned alot of other tools.</p>
